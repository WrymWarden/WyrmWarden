# WyrmWarden

Hia! I'm the Wyrm Warden, owner and currently sole member of the Book Wyrm Archives. I'm a solo developer mostly interested in making games and I feel like pathing a trail of my journey towards those endeavors.

## What you'll find here
The primary purpose for this GitHub page is to host the Archive, the whole of my journey through learning and hopefully one day excelling in game developement. As I learn and grow, I intend to make those resources public, and any projects I make for the foreseeable future can be found here for you to puruse. </br>
I want to let others follow my work, offer feedback when available, ask questions when needed, and help themselves learn through my mistakes and successes. Perhaps it is presumptious of me to create this so early in my journey, but I feel it necessary to capture these early days more than most others.

## Who am I?
You can call me the Wyrm Warden. I'm a 20-something self-taught programmer who thinks it sounds fun to try and make some video games. I've been playing with code since I was itsy, both through robotics and through personal projects. I adore music and have been an avid chior member for much of my life.</br>
As of now I have little artistic talent to speak of, my professional credentials are underwhelming, and I have done little more than create a myriad of prototypes and small projects, most of which are scattered into the data-ether that is the microsoft trash can.

## Anywho
Hope you find this a useful resource or an entertaining distraction. You can find the archives here ([Link to the Archive GitHub page]), and can profer any questions or comments you have to [my email](TheWyrmWarden@gmail.com). I hope one day in the future I can deem it warented to create additional social medias, at which point I can add them here as well.
